publish: # Publish the project artefact @Pipeline
	# TODO: Implement the artefact publishing step

deploy: # Deploy the project artefact to the target environment @Pipeline
	# TODO: Implement the artefact deployment step

clean:: # Clean-up project resources (main) @Operations
	# TODO: Implement project resources clean-up step

config:: # Configure development environment (main) @Configuration
	# TODO: Use only 'make' targets that are specific to this project, e.g. you may not need to install Node.js
